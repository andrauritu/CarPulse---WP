## Overview
This application has two main user types: **Admin** and **Family Members**.  
One person is designated as the Admin, responsible for managing all major car maintenance details. The rest of the users are Family Members, who can view and make small edits but do not have full management privileges.

## Admin
- **Role Description:**  
  - The Admin is responsible for adding, updating, and removing maintenance records for the household’s cars.
  
- **Informal User Stories:**  
  - “As an Admin, I want to add new maintenance records (like oil changes or tire rotations), so I can keep an accurate log of each car’s upkeep.”  
  - “As an Admin, I want to update existing records with new details (such as mileage or replaced parts), so everyone has the latest information.”  
  - “As an Admin, I want to delete or remove outdated or incorrect entries, so the maintenance history stays relevant and accurate.”

## Family Members (Users)
- **Role Description:**  
  - Family Members can see all the records the Admin has added. They can also edit small details (like correcting a date or updating a note), but **cannot** create new entries themselves.

- **Informal User Stories:**  
  - “As a Family Member, I want to see the most recent maintenance records for my car, so I know when the next service is due.”  
  - “As a Family Member, I want to fix small errors (like a wrong date or incorrect mileage) on an existing record, so the log remains accurate.”  
  - “As a Family Member, I should not be able to add new maintenance entries, so the Admin maintains full control of official records.”

## Future Plans
- Additional features may be introduced, such as enhanced permissions or notifications.
- The current setup is intentionally simple, giving the Admin major control and allowing Family Members only limited edits.
